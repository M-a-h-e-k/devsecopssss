# üîê SecureSphere Registration System & UI Updates

## ‚úÖ **All Requirements Successfully Implemented**

### üéØ **Changes Implemented**

#### 1. **‚úÖ Collapsible Sections in Lead Review**
- **Problem**: Lead review UI was messy and bulky with all questions displayed
- **Solution**: Implemented collapsible accordion-style sections
- **Features**:
  - Section-wise question grouping under each client's product
  - Animated chevron icons for expand/collapse state
  - First section expanded by default, others collapsed
  - Smooth CSS transitions for better UX
  - Maintains all existing functionality

#### 2. **‚úÖ Removed Default User Accounts**
- **Problem**: Default demo accounts were not needed for production
- **Solution**: Cleaned up initialization to only create admin
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `lead_reviewer`, `demo_client`, `enterprise_client` accounts
  - Only creates essential `admin` user for system management
  - Updated initialization scripts and documentation
  - Clean start for production deployment

#### 3. **‚úÖ New Invitation-Based Registration System**
- **Problem**: Open registration with role selection was not secure
- **Solution**: Implemented secure invitation-only registration

#### **üìß For Clients (Invitation Link Registration)**:
- Admin generates secure invitation links with 7-day expiration
- Clients receive unique, single-use registration links
- Email verification ensures only intended recipient can register
- Role is pre-assigned in invitation (no role selection during registration)
- Organization can be pre-filled or client can update during registration

#### **üë§ For Lead Reviewers (Direct Admin Creation)**:
- Admin creates lead accounts directly with credentials
- Immediate account creation with username/password
- Admin provides credentials to lead reviewers
- No email invitation process needed for leads

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **New Database Models**
```sql
-- InvitationToken Table
CREATE TABLE invitation_tokens (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    token VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,  -- 'client' or 'lead'
    organization VARCHAR(200),
    invited_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    expires_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    used_at DATETIME
);
```

### **New Admin Routes**
- `/admin/invite_user` - Generate invitation links for clients/leads
- `/admin/manage_users` - View all users and pending invitations
- `/admin/create_lead` - Direct lead creation with credentials
- `/admin/revoke_invitation/<id>` - Revoke pending invitations

### **Updated Registration Flow**
1. **Registration requires invitation token in URL**: `/register?token=xyz`
2. **Token validation**: Checks for valid, unexpired, unused token
3. **Email matching**: Ensures registration email matches invitation email
4. **Role assignment**: Role comes from invitation, not user selection
5. **Single-use tokens**: Tokens are marked as used after successful registration

### **Security Features**
- **Secure tokens**: 256-bit URL-safe tokens using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`
- **Expiration**: 7-day automatic expiration for invitations
- **Single-use**: Tokens can only be used once
- **Email verification**: Registration email must match invitation email
- **Admin-only control**: Only superusers can create invitations and lead accounts

## üé® **UI/UX Improvements**

### **Lead Review Dashboard**
- **Collapsible sections** with smooth animations
- **Better organization** - questions grouped by section under products
- **Cleaner interface** - only first section expanded by default
- **Visual indicators** - chevron icons show expand/collapse state
- **Maintained functionality** - all existing features preserved

### **Registration Page**
- **Invitation context** - Shows who invited user and for what role
- **Email pre-filling** - Invitation email is read-only
- **Role display** - Clear indication of assigned role
- **Expiration warning** - Shows when invitation expires
- **Simplified form** - No role selection, cleaner interface

### **Admin Interface**

- **Invitation Creation** - Easy form to generate invitation links
- **Lead Creation** - Direct form to create lead accounts
- **Pending Invitations** - View, copy, and revoke pending invitations
- **Copy-to-clipboard** - Easy sharing of invitation links

## üîê **Security Enhancements**

### **Access Control**
- **No public registration** - All registration requires admin-generated invitations
- **Role-based access** - Roles are assigned by admin, not self-selected
- **Admin oversight** - Complete visibility and control over user creation

### **Audit Trail**
- **Invitation tracking** - Who invited whom, when, and expiration
- **Usage tracking** - When invitations were used and by whom
- **User creation log** - Complete history of user account creation
- **Admin activity** - All admin actions are logged with timestamps

## üìã **Workflow Examples**

### **Client Onboarding Workflow**
1. **Admin** creates invitation via `/admin/invite_user`
2. **System** generates secure link: `/register?token=abc123...`
