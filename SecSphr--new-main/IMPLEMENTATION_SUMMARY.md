# Implementation Summary - Questionnaire Form State & Dashboard Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Questionnaire Form State Retention**
- **Problem**: Radio buttons weren't retaining their state when navigating between sections
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `fill_questionnaire_section()` function in `app.py` to load existing responses
  - Added `existing_answers` parameter to template context
  - Updated `templates/fill_questionnaire_section.html` to pre-populate radio buttons and comments with existing data
  - Enhanced form handling to prevent duplicate responses by deleting existing responses before saving new ones

**Files Modified**: 
- `app.py` (lines 250-300)
- `templates/fill_questionnaire_section.html` (radio button and textarea sections)

### 2. **Updated Lead Dashboard - Client-wise and Product-wise View**
- **Problem**: Lead dashboard showed all responses mixed together
- **Solution**:
  - Modified lead dashboard query to organize responses by client and product
  - Created hierarchical structure: Client → Products → Responses
  - Updated template to display responses in organized sections
  - Added client filtering instead of section filtering
  - Updated statistics to show client count, product count, and total responses

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (dashboard function for lead role)
- `templates/dashboard_lead.html` (complete restructure of display and filtering)

### 3. **Updated Superuser Dashboard - Product-wise and Dimension-wise Results**
- **Problem**: Superuser dashboard showed overall statistics without product-specific insights
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced superuser dashboard to calculate dimension-wise scores for each product
  - Added scoring algorithm based on answer types (Yes/High=100%, Partially/Medium=50%, No/Low=0%)
  - Created product cards showing individual dimension scores with progress bars
  - Color-coded progress bars based on score ranges (Green ≥75%, Yellow ≥50%, Red <50%)
  - Added product owner information and response counts

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py` (dashboard function for superuser role)
- `templates/dashboard_superuser.html` (product display section)

### 4. **Enhanced Radio Button Behavior**
- **Problem**: Radio buttons needed better state management and validation
- **Solution**:
  - Ensured only one option can be selected per question (inherent radio button behavior)
  - Added proper `checked` attribute for pre-selected options
  - Enhanced form validation to ensure all questions are answered
  - Improved visual feedback for selected options

### 5. **Fixed Jinja Template Issues**
- **Problem**: Potential Jinja2 template errors when starting assessments
- **Solution**:
  - Verified all template syntax is correct
  - Ensured proper variable passing between backend and templates
  - Added proper null checks for optional data
  - Fixed loop context references
