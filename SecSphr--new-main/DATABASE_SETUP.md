- **Monitoring**: Track database performance
- **Updates**: Keep schema current with features

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check database integrity
python3 -c "from init_database import verify_database; verify_database()"

# Monitor database size
du -h instance/securesphere.db

# Check table statistics
sqlite3 instance/securesphere.db "SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master JOIN sqlite_sequence ON name = seq GROUP BY name;"
```
