# Lead Review System Fixes - SecureSphere

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lead Review Column Alignment and Indentation
**Problem**: Column alignment and indentation issues in the lead review section table
**Solution**: 
- Added specific CSS styling for `.dashboard-lead .table` elements
- Proper column width allocation (5%, 40%, 15%, 15%, 10%, 15%)
- Improved text alignment for all columns
- Enhanced question text wrapping and indentation

### 2. Rejected Questions Not Coming Back to Client
**Problem**: When lead marks questions as "rejected", they don't properly return to client for re-submission
**Solution**:
- Added `needs_client_response` column to `questionnaire_response` table
- Updated rejection handling in `review_questionnaire` route
- Modified dashboard logic to check for rejected responses requiring client attention
- Added proper status handling: `is_reviewed = False` and `needs_client_response = True` for rejected responses

### 3. Half-Completed Assessments Going to Lead Review
**Problem**: Incomplete assessments (partial question responses) were showing up in lead review
**Solution**:
- Updated `dashboard_lead` route to filter responses using `is_assessment_complete()`
- Only show products with completed assessments to leads for review
- Prevents review of incomplete work

### 4. Text Alignment Issues in Lead Review Section
**Problem**: Text alignment was inconsistent in the lead review tables
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive CSS rules for `.dashboard-lead .table` styling
- Proper vertical and horizontal alignment for all table elements
- Improved question text display with proper line height and padding
- Enhanced question number styling with consistent centering

### 5. Question Number Tick Removal
**Problem**: Question numbers were showing tick marks after being answered, which was not required
**Solution**:
- Modified `.question-number.completed` CSS to remove tick icon
- Set `display: none` for tick icon and number text
- Maintained consistent styling without visual clutter
