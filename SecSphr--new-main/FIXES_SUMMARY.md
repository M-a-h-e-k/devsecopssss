# SecureSphere Web Application - Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: ValueError - "too many values to unpack (expected 2)"

**Problem**: The template `fill_questionnaire_section.html` was trying to unpack the `questions` variable incorrectly.

**Root Cause**: The line `{% for qidx, question in questions %}` was expecting each item in `questions` to be a tuple with 2 elements, but `questions` is actually a list of dictionaries.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `{% for qidx, question in questions %}` to `{% for question in questions %}`
- Replaced all `{{ qidx }}` references with `{{ loop.index0 }}` (Jinja2's loop counter)
- Updated form field names:
  - `name="answer_{{ qidx }}"` → `name="answer_{{ loop.index0 }}"`
  - `name="comment_{{ qidx }}"` → `name="comment_{{ loop.index0 }}"`
  - `name="evidence_{{ qidx }}"` → `name="evidence_{{ loop.index0 }}"`
- Fixed question numbering: `{{ qidx + 1 }}` → `{{ loop.index }}`

## Issue 2: Color Scheme Visibility Problems

**Problem**: The navbar brand "SecureSphere" was not clearly visible against the gradient background.

**Solutions Applied**:

### 1. Enhanced Base Template (`templates/base.html`)
- Added stronger text shadow for navbar brand
- Increased font weight to 700
- Improved letter spacing
- Added hover effects with better contrast

### 2. Improved CSS Color Scheme (`static/style.css`)
- Added new CSS variables for better color management:
  - `--navbar-gradient`
  - `--card-bg`, `--card-border`
  - `--input-border`, `--input-focus`
  - `--text-contrast`
  - `--shadow-strong`

### 3. Enhanced Component Styling
- **Navbar Brand**: Increased font size, weight, and text shadow
- **Cards**: Added subtle borders and improved hover effects
- **Forms**: Better border colors and focus states
- **Overall**: Improved contrast ratios for better accessibility

## Files Modified

1. `templates/fill_questionnaire_section.html` - Fixed the template loop error
2. `templates/base.html` - Enhanced navbar styling
3. `static/style.css` - Improved color scheme and component styling

## Testing

The application now imports successfully and the template loop structure has been verified to work correctly with the actual data structure from the CSV file.

## Result

- ✅ ValueError fixed - questionnaire forms now load without errors
- ✅ Improved visibility - navbar brand and UI elements are now clearly visible
- ✅ Better user experience - enhanced color scheme and styling
- ✅ Maintained functionality - all existing features preserved
